# Example of a two-sample t-test in Python

## Dependencies

```
numpy
scipy
```

## Introduction

Let's imagine we have a hotel booking website and wish to study if a given change in our website can boost our average daily conversion rates (at the final stage of the booking process). We decide then to make an A/B test to help us determine if we want to release such a change. For this example, let's set the significance level to 0.05 (alpha) and the statistical power (1-beta) to 0.8 (the statistical power will be used to define the minimum sample size).

In this example, our null hypothesis states that there is no significant difference between the average daily conversion rates with or without such a change in the website.

In ```example.py```, you will find the implementation of a two-sample t-test, including the generation of fake data as well as the determination of the minimum sample size.
